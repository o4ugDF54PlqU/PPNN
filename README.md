Password Prediction Neural Network Proof of Concept

Included are multiple RNNs made to train and identify a person's style of writing and thoughts based off of their tweets. Early versions are merely LSTM text generators and the more current ones try to generate something that is closer to a password.

Why is this a thing?
I believe that with enough data, a person's conscious mind can be modeled and closely replicated. Therefore, users need to be more aware and careful with the amount of private information that they post online while companies needs to be more careful about how their user's data is handled.
